# Simple Search Engine 
## Description
------------
Simple Web-based News Search Engine from Text File using Booyer-Moore, KMP algorithm and RegEx with Flask Server 

## Requirements
-----------
1. Python 3, here I'm using python 3.7
2. Recommended using Windows, as I'm using it. But, you can try in linux, such as Ubuntu Linux
3. Virtualenv (python lib)
4. Additional python lib/framework: flask, pyhton-dotenv (of course all of it installed in venv)
   
<!-- For point 3 & 4, actually I've included them in this project, so you don't need to worry. -->

## How to Run
------------
1. Install all requirements, for the python lib you can install by executing **install_req.bat** in this project (in case env folder removed)
2. open shell(cmd/powershell) and change directory to *env/Script*
3. execute

        activate

to run virtualenv
4. execute
   
        flask run
   
to run the server

For simplicity you can executing **run.bat** instead of step 2-4
